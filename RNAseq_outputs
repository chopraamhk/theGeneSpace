Analysed RNAseq data? Confused if you should use RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads)/FPKM Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads or TPM (Transcripts per million)?

Let us start understanding what each of them represents - 

RPKM and FPKM are almost the same. However, FPKM is used when we have paired-end reads. However, RPKM is used when we are dealing with single-end reads. Normalisation follows:
Step1: normalise sequencing depths (i.e., total reads/million)
Step2: normalise by gene length size

TPMs are like them only. However, the normalisation method is the opposite of RPKM/FPKM. In TPMs, 
Step1: normalise gene length size
Step2: normalise sequencing depths

Why have we started to use TPM? 
TPMs provide the proportion of reads mapped to what is in each sample. This metric seems more appropriate since RNAseq is all about comparing relative proportions.
